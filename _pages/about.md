I am Xinyi Zhou, currently a Master student pursuing the degree of [Master of Science in Computer Science (General)](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/computer-science-general/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Southern California and a student researcher for [USC ACE Lab](https://aceatusc.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Souti Rini Chattopadhyay](https://soutirini.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Before coming to the USC, I obtained the Bachelor of Engineering in CSE at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTECH](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"}) advised by [Dr.Jiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NHt3fUcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"}, during which I worked as an undergraduate researcher in his lab [iMED](http://www.imed-lab.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Experience
From May 2024 to August 2024, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at [Veeva Systems](https://www.veeva.com/){:target="_blank"}. I contributed to the Vault Platform Reporting team, helping maintain a Spring Boot and React-based cloud platform. I resolved 11 critical defects, implemented a "Last Updated" time indicator to enhance user experience for over 1,000 customers, and improved unit test coverage using JUnit and Jest.

From May 2023 to August 2023, I worked as a Machine Learning (NLP) engineer at [UBT Robotics](https://www.ubtrobot.com/){:target="_blank"} on large language models. I fine-tuned LLM chatbots (Vicuna 7B, 13B, and 33B) based on the over 50,000 ChatGPT-generated Welcoming and Guiding Dialogues. Preliminary user evaluation indicates a 29.74% user preference enhancement over the original Vicuna chatbot.

From August 2022 to December 2022, I worked as a research assistant for Dr.[Luo Tao](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/about/team/faculty/375.html){:target="_blank"} at SUSTECH's [School of Design](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/en){:target="_blank"}, mainly responsible for Unity MR development, [IxDL](http://ixdlanguage.org/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} user survey, and HCI-experiment design.

From March 2022 to June 2022, I worked as a front-end engineer for a start-up named Êú™ÁïåÁßëÊäÄ(Weijie Technology). This company aims to strengthen the industry of [Murder Mystery Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_mystery_game){:target="_blank"} with computer technology.  

From November 2021 to February 2022, I worked as an intern at the Industrial Services Department in [National Innovation Center for Advanced Medical Devices](http://nmed.org.cn/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of Peng Zhao.
